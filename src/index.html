    This is a book for children and parents about the future of work.  Riley tries to decide on a job she might want someday but one after another all of her ideas are met with a rebuttal from her robot friend Bot that robots can do those things better than people and are now doing those jobs.  When she finally learns that robots can even be painters and songwriters, she nearly explodes in frustration before Bot points out all the jobs that people are better at and how there will be new jobs for people that don’t exist yet.
    <br/><br/>
    The viewpoint of this book is that our world is rapidly changing and our children are going to someday find themselves in a job market like we’ve never seen before.  No one knows how things will play out but my hope is this book will plant a seed that will hopefully guide kids towards a career path that is more likely to be working along side robots and AI rather than being replaced by it.
